# Autocar-Sandbox
An app to help make  AI for self driving car, it allows recording data (Inputs, surrounding distances, speed, ...) and connecting to an AI model (through UDP connection) to test the model.

The project was developed on Godot 4.2 (consider using this version only, other versions may not work).

You can use and customize the UDP server example (in network_server/server.py) to run your AI model and make sure of the correct transmission of data.

The project still needs bug fixes, organisation and documentation for better understanding of how things work.
